# Find Me

In today's digital world, everything we post online can last forever. A silly comment or photo from years ago might come back to haunt us, especially if a future employer finds it and doesnâ€™t share their reasons for not hiring us. This reality emphasizes the importance of being careful about what we share online and ensuring our accounts are secure.

For my project, I aim to create a system that can locate online data linked to specific usernames or email addresses. By doing this, I want to help users understand what information is out there about them, allowing them to take steps to protect their online presence. My goal is to empower individuals to manage their digital footprints more effectively and promote safer online practices.

Moreover, the goals of this project are extended. I am in the process of learning JavaScript and utilising the Nuxt framework (a free and open source JavaScript library based on Vue.js, Nitro, and Vite) for both the front and back end of this project.
